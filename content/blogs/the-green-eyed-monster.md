Shakespeare called it the "green-eyed monster," a beast that mocks the meat it feeds on. Jealousy is a curious emotion. It's not about what you lack; it's about what someone else has.

### The Mirror

I've learned that jealousy is rarely about the other person. It's a mirror reflecting your own insecurities. When you feel that twinge of envy, it's a signal. It's your mind telling you what you value but haven't yet achieved.

> "Comparison is the thief of joy."

Instead of letting it consume you, use it. Let it be the fuel. If you want what they have, go build it. The monster only grows if you feed it silence and resentment.
